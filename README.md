Decentralized Solar Energy Network on Sui

SunChain — Decentralized Solar Energy Network on Sui

Title Slide:

Project: SunChain
Tagline: Powering a Connected Africa through Decentralized Energy Infrastructure
Built on: Sui Blockchain
By: Isarck Eser (Team SunChain)


## Problem Statement:

Millions of Africans lack reliable electricity.
Grid power is inconsistent, expensive, and centralized.
Rural communities depend on fuel generators that harm the environment.


## Our Solution — SunChain:

A DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) connecting community solar hubs using Sui.
Each hub records energy data on-chain for transparency & trust.
Users pay via Sui smart contracts using stablecoins.


## Why Sui:

Ultra-fast & low-cost transactions for micro energy payments.
Real-time data tracking via on-chain oracles & IoT integration.
Scalable enough for millions of microgrid users.


## How It Works:

1. Communities install solar panels & smart IoT meters.

2. Data is sent to Sui and stored on-chain.

3. Users buy tokens or pay directly for electricity.

4. Transparent revenue distribution to maintainers & investors.


## Impact:

Access to clean, affordable power.
New economic opportunities for rural tech operators.
Proof that blockchain can power real-world infrastructure.


## Traction (Pilot):

10 solar units installed across 3 locations.
100+ users registered for pilot.
80%+ uptime, 70%+ success in data sync.

## Funding Request:

$5,000

Use of Funds:

- Hardware expansion (solar IoT units)

- Smart contract audits

- Dashboard & mobile app improvements


## Security Approach:

On-chain verification of energy data.
Escrow smart contracts for payments.
Plan to conduct external security audit before mainnet.
